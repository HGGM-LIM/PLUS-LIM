\page AlgorithmPivotCalibration Pivot calibration algorithm

This algorithm computes transformation between the tip of a tracked pointer and the coordinate system of tracking marker attached to the object.

Usually the marker's coordinate system is named as Stylus,
the coordinate system that has its origin at the tooltip is named as StylusTip. The StylusTip coordinate system
can be chosen to have the same orientation as the Stylus coordinate system, however this may not be aligned with
the principal axes of the stylus object. This misalignment may be confusing for the users. The StylusTip coordinate
system could be aligned with the principal axes of the stylus, by asking the user to translate or sping the stylus along its
axes or to perform a landmark registration. However, these extra steps increase the complexity of the procedure and
generally the accuracy of the stylus orientation is not critical, as it is used for visual representation only.
Therefore, in Plus the approximate stylus orientation is computed from the data acquired for the pivot calibration.
The marker's origin (Stylus coordinate system origin) is assumed to be close to the long axis of the stylus,
therefore the -Z axis of the StylusTip coordinate system is chosen as the unit vector pointing from the StylusTip
origin to the Stylus origin and the other two axes are aligned with the X and Y axes of the Stylus coordinate system.
