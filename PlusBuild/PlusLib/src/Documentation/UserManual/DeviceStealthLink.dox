\page DeviceStealthLink Medtronic Stealth Station

This class talks with StealthLink Server and acquires the transformation matrix data for both the current frame
and the instrument. Only one instrument and one frame can be acitive at a time.

Nomenclature:
- Medtronic: localizer = Plus: tracker
- Medtronic: frame = Plus: reference marker (sensor or marker attached to the reference body)
- Medtronic: instrument = Plus: tool marker (sensor or marker attached to the tool)

\section StealthLinkSupportedHwDevices Supported hardware devices

- Medtronic StealthStation that has StealthLink licence.
- Link to manufacturer's website: http://www.medtronic.com/for-healthcare-professionals/products-therapies/spinal/surgical-navigation-imaging/surgical-navigation-systems/systems-software-instruments/

\section StealthLinkSupportedPlatforms Included in packages

- \ref PackageStealthLink

This device is not included in any of the standard packages, as it requires StealthLink library from Medtronic.
If the StealthLink library is obtained from Medtronic then Plus have to be built with the StealthLink option enabled as described at https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/wiki/Windows_Build_Instructions.
The device is tested on Windows, but should also work on other platforms.

\section StealthLinkInstallation Installation

No need to install any extra software. The StealthStation needs to be connected through LAN and the connection is set via IP address and port number.

\section StealthLinkConfigSettings Device configuration settings

- \xmlAtt \ref DeviceType "Type" = \c "StealthLink" \RequiredAtt

- \xmlAtt \ref DeviceAcquisitionRate "AcquisitionRate" \OptionalAtt{30} 
- \xmlAtt \ref LocalTimeOffsetSec \OptionalAtt{0}
- \xmlAtt \ref ToolReferenceFrame \OptionalAtt{Tracker}

- \xmlAtt \b ServerAddress. IP address of the StealthStation. \RequiredAtt
- \xmlAtt \b ServerPort. Port number of the StealthStation. \RequiredAtt

- \xmlElem \ref DataSources One \c DataSource child element is required for each tool or reference marker \RequiredAtt
   - \xmlElem \ref DataSource \RequiredAtt
    - \xmlAtt \ref BufferSize \OptionalAtt{150}
    - \xmlAtt \ref PortName \RequiredAtt
      - Any instrument name. Instrument names defined in StealthStation must match tools' port names defined in the configuration file (example: `Passive Planar, Blunt`, `Navigus Probe`).
      - Any frame name. Frame names defined in StealthStation must match tools' port names defined in the configuration file (example: `Small Passive Cranial Frame`).
      - \c RasRegistration. Refers to the image's RAS coordinate system (therefore it is recommended to set the Tool Id to `Ras`). This virtual tool will only give valid value when an image is acquired from the server (GetImage or GetExamData).

\section UseCases Use cases

Both optical and Em tracker can be used.

\subsection StealthLinkUsagePlusServerRemoteControl Usage from PlusServerRemoteControl

Start plus server with the configuration file as the input. 

    PlusServer.exe --config-file=PlusDeviceSet_Server_StealthLinkTracker.xml

With this you can track the tools that are inside the view of the tracker.

Stealth can receive DICOM image files from the stealth server and send them as volume through OpenIGTLink:

    PlusServerRemoteControl.exe --command=GET_EXAM_DATA --device=SLD --dicom-directory="C:\StealthLinkDicomOutput\" --volumeEmbeddedTransformToFrame="Ras" --keepReceivedDicomFiles

It will get the current exam information and the registration information and send volume and its pose in Ras coordinate system.
Ras is calculated after having read the information from the received dicom files ((0020,0032) ImagePositionPatient and (0020,0037) ImageOrientationPatient).

 - \c dicom-directory you can specifiy a folder and this folder will be where the DICOM files are stored. \OptionalAtt{plus output directory}.
 - \c volumeEmbeddedTransformToFrame. you can define in what coordinate system you want the image to be in \c "Reference" or \c "Ras". \OptionalAtt{Ras}
 - \c keepReceivedDicomFiles. If this exists then the DICOM files will be stored if not deleted. The default is delete.
 
\subsection StealthLinkUsageSlicer Usage in 3D Slicer

Start plus server with the configuration file as the input.

    PlusServer.exe --config-file=PlusDeviceSet_Server_StealthLinkTracker.xml

 - Start 3D Slicer
 - Go to \c OpenIGTLinkIF module
 - Click "+" to create a new connection, select the new connection, click "Client", click "Active"
 - The \c StylusToTracker transform is created in Slicer and it is updated by the stylus tracking. The \c ReferenceToTracker and other transforms are available too.
 - Go to \c OpenIGTLinkRemote module
 - Select the StealthLink connection in the Connector list
 - Click "Update" to query the available image
 - Select the image and click "Get selected items" to load it into Slicer

Using OpenIGTLink messages \c GET_IMGMETA and \c GET_IMAGE(from a slicer client for example)

- \c GET_IMGMETA plus will receive all the image meta data information from all of the connected devices and send it through openigtlink
- \c GET_IMAGE will send the volume and the orientation and position in Ras coordinate system.This system should be defined in the configuration file.
