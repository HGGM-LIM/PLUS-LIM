\page FileLog Log file

Plus log files are created automatically during the execution of any Plus application in
the output directory (MMDDYY_HHMMSS_PlusLog.txt).
If you encounter any problem running an application open the log file and look for ERROR or WARNING messages.

The directory where log files are saved is specified in the OutputDirectory attribute in the \ref FileApplicationConfiguration.
If a relative path is specified in the OutputDirectory attribute then it is interpreted as relative to the location of
the \ref FileApplicationConfiguration .

\section FileLogViewing Viewing log files

Any text editor can be used for viewing the log files, but a log viewer software is recommended.

The log file format is compatible with the free <a href="http://logexpert.codeplex.com/">LogExpert log viewer</a>.
With LogExpert you can even monitor the log file in real-time, while a Plus application is running for more convenient
reading and define custom trigger actions (start a process, bookmark the location, flash an icon, etc).
