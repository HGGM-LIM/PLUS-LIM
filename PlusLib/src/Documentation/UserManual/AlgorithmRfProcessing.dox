\page AlgorithmRfProcessing RF processing algorithm

This algorithm can convert RF data to B-mode images. The conversion is performed in two steps:
- Brightness conversion: the RF samples converted to brightness values
- Scan conversion: RF lines are pasted into an image according to the defined transducer geometry.
To convert recorded RF data to B-mode use the \ref ApplicationRfProcessor.

Information on transducer geometry can be obtained from the probe manufacturer.
If the manufacturer does not disclose all necessary information or to verify the transducer geometry:
acquire a B-mode and an RF-mode frame of the same object and compare the received B-mode image to the
B-mode image that RfProcessor constructed from the received RF frame
