This algorithm determines the transformation between the ultrasound image and a tracker marker rigidly attached to somewhere on the ultrasound probe.

We recommend using 3 N-wires as we have found this to be more robust and accurate than using just 2 N-wires but still can be robustly detected and kept in the field of view. Specification of the wire pattern is available at https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusLib/docs/fCAL/CAD. XML description can be found in the example device set configuration files. 

You can add any number of N-wires with any angles between the side and middle wires (angle can be different for each N-wire) with the following conditions:
- all N-wires shall be completely visible at the same time in the ultrasound image
- planes of N-wires shall be parallel
- only one N-wire is allowed on a plane (they should not be placed side-by-side, only above/below each other)

N-wires should cover about the same area of the ultrasound image (same size and location) during registration as your region of interest (e.g., if you image
a 40mm diameter object 50mm from the transducer then during calibration the N-wires should cover about 40mm range, about 50mm from the transducer).

You can find the CAD models and snapshots of fCal calibration phantoms in the following directories:
- https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusLib/data/CADModels/fCalPhantom
- https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusLib/docs/fCAL/CAD

fCal-2.x is recommended for smaller field of view (up to about 10cm imaging depth). The hole positions are the same for fCal-1.x and fCal-2.x (only some text labels and marker mounting holes are added) but fCal_2.x has extra holes that allow using 3 N-wires, which greatly increases the accuracy and robustness (compared to using just 2 N-wires), therefore using fCal-1.x is not recommended.

If you image large structures then you probably need fCal 3 phantom. However, fCal-3.x is assembled from multiple pieces (to limit reduce 3D printing time and costs), and so it may be somewhat less accurate then the smaller, unibody fCal-2.x.
