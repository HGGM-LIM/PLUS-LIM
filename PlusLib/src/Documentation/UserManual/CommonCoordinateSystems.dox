\page CommonCoordinateSystems Definition of commonly used coordinate systems

In Plus the following coordinate systems are used commonly:

Reference frame name  | Origin  | Unit  | Axes directions
----------------------|---------|-------|-----------------
Tracker   | Origin of the tracking system (position of the field generator, camera, etc.)  | mm  | as defined by the tracking system manufacturer
Stylus    | Origin of the marker that is attached to the pointer tool | mm  | as defined by the tracking system / marker manufacturer
Probe     | Origin of the marker that is attached to the ultrasound probe (transducer)  | mm  | as defined by the tracking system / marker manufacturer
Reference | Origin of the marker attached to the object of interest (phantom, cadaver, patient, etc.) | mm  | as defined by the tracking system / marker manufacturer
StylusTip | Tip of the stylus | mm  | X axis: aligned with the Stylus coordinate system's X axis (unless StylusTip Z axis is parallel with the StylusTip Z axis - in this case the StylusTip Y axis is aligned with the Stylus X axis). <br/> Y axis: chosen to be the cross product of the Z and X axes. <br/> Z axis: the axis that points from the Stylus coordinate system origin towards StylusTip coordinate syste origin.
Image     | Position of the pixel that is in the origin of the MF oriented image  | pixel | X axis: towards the marked side of the transducer <br/> Y axis: towards the direction that points away (far) from the transducer <br/> Z axis: cross product of X and Y
Transducer| Center of the transducer crystal array | mm | X axis: towards the marked side of the transducer <br/> Y axis: towards the direction that points away (far) from the transducer <br/> Z axis: cross product of X and Y
