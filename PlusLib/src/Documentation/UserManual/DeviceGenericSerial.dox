\page DeviceGenericSerial Generic serial device

This device communicates with external hardware using serial (RS-232) connection
It does not collect tracking or image data, only allows sending and receiving data
using OpenIGTLink commands (see \ref PlusServerCommands).

A (customizable) newline string is appended after each sent command and the device listens
for reponse that is terminated by the same newline string.
