The device manufacturer supports additional platforms. On request, Plus toolkit will be extended to support this device on other platforms, too.

\section MicronInstallation Installation
- Each tool is identified by its unique marker pattern - by the number and relative position of the constituting "x-marks".
  MicronTracker's CPPDemo tool (included in the MicronTracker software package) can identify a marker and
  create a marker descriptor "template" file. All the template files must be placed into the "TemplateDirectory" specified in the configuration file.
- If Plus does not find any tool then run CPPDemo and verify that the marker is in the field of view and recognizable.
- The 1394 interface that your computer already has may not work with the camera. If the MicronTracker demo programs don't work then use the interface card that came with your MicronTracker package.
