  \class vtkNDITracker
  \brief Interface class for Northern Digital's tracking devices

  The vtkNDITracker class provides an  interface to the AURORA and POLARIS
  (Northern Digital Inc., Waterloo, Canada) using the new "combined API" and
  should also support all newer NDI tracking devices.  Any POLARIS systems
  purchased before 2002 will not support the combined API.

  For active (wired) tools specify PortName attribute. For example,
  PortName="0" is the first port, PortName="1" is the second, etc.

  If multi-channel tools are used then the PortName is <ChannelNumber><PortNumber>,
  for example for two 5-DOF sensors plugged into the first connector:
  PortName="0" and PortName="100", for two 5-DOF sensors plugged into the second connector:
  PortName="1" and PortName="101".

  For passive (wireless) tools specify RomFile attribute. For example,
  RomFile="NdiToolDefinitions/8700339.rom".

  Important notes on the data collection rate of the Polaris:

  The camera frame rate is 60Hz, and therefore the maximum data
  collection rate is also 60Hz.  The maximum data transfer rate
  to the computer is also 60Hz.

  Depending on the number of enabled tools, the data collection
  rate might be reduced.  Each of the active tools requires one
  camera frame, and all the passive tools (if any are enabled)
  collectively require one camera frame.

  Therefore if there are two enabled active tools, the data rate
  is reduced to 30Hz.  Ditto for an active tool and a passive tool.
  If all tools are passive, the data rate is 60Hz.  With 3 active
  tools and one or more passive tools, the data rate is 15Hz.
  With 3 active tools, or 2 active and one or more passive tools,
  the data rate is 20Hz.

  The data transfer rate to the computer is independent of the data
  collection rate, and there might be duplicated records.  The
  data tranfer rate is limited by the speed of the serial port
  and by the number of characters sent per data record.  If tools
  are marked as 'missing' then the number of characters that
  are sent will be reduced.
