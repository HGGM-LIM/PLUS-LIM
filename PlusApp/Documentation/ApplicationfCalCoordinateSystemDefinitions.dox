Coordinate systems used in fCal:

Reference frame name  | Origin  | Unit  | Axes directions
----------------------|---------|-------|-----------------
Phantom   | fCal-2.x and fCal-3.x phantoms: inside end of the A5 hole on the front (see picture).|  mm  | X axis: from column A to B direction <br/> Y axis: towards the back side of the phantom <br/> Z axis: from row 4 to row 1 direction
Reference | Origin of the marker that is attached to the calibration phantom |  mm  | as defined by the tracking system / marker manufacturer
TransducerOrigin      | Position of the pixel that is in the middle of the first line of the MF oriented image. In PLUS it's only used for approximate visualization of the transducer 3D model.  | mm  | Same as Image
TransducerOriginPixel | Same as TransducerOrigin  | pixel | Same as TransdrucerOrigin
