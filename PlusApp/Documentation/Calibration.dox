\page Calibration Calibration

# Overview

Typically tracking and imaging devices require spatial and temporal calibration after they are set up.

Spatial calibration algorithms determine unknown transformations that remain constant after the system is set up.
Typically these are transformations between the coordinate systems of an object (e.g., image slice, calibration phantom, stylus)
and a tracking marker that is rigidly attached to that object.
- \ref AlgorithmPivotCalibration is used for computing the transformation between the tip(`StylusTip`) of a pointer tool (a.k.a. stylus)
and the marker that is attached to the tool (`Stylus`).
- \ref AlgorithmPhantomRegistration determines the transformation between the calibration phantom's coordinate system (`Phantom`)
and the attached marker's coordinate system (`Reference`). The method uses landmark registration: transformation between an object
and the attached marker is computed by touching predefined positions on the object with a tracked stylus.
- \ref AlgorithmProbeCalibration is used for determining the transformation between
the coordinate system of the image (`Image`) and the marker that is attached to the US transducer (`Probe`).

\ref AlgorithmTemporalCalibration determines time offset between data streams acquired by different devices. Temporal calibration
is essential if data is acquired while tracked tools are moving, because then any temporal misalignment results in spatial errors.

# Calibration using fCal

\ref ApplicationfCal implements all the above described calibration algorithms in a single application.

# Calibration using SlicerIGT modules

<a href="http://www.slicerigt.org">SlicerIGT</a> extension of 3D Slicer contains a number of spatial calibration modules that allow
computing transforms and using them in Plus.
